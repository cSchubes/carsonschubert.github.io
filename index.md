### Let's solve the tough problems.

Thanks for taking the time to visit my website. Here you'll find my resume, details about some of my favorite
projects I've worked on, and a bit of information about me.  

If you know me, you know I don't shy away from a challenge. I spend most of my time thinking about the biggest
problems and questions facing humanity today - and how I can best help solve them. From dark matter to climate change, 
the universe presents us with a myriad of challenges on a daily basis. Let's work together to find the solutions.
