The Texas Spacecraft Laboratory (TSL) is a student-driven research group dedicated to designing and building small satellites, securing launches into space, 
and operating them once in orbit. I joined the lab as a sophomore undergrad and was privileged to see a project through from start to final delivery as a team 
lead during my sophomore year. I worked as the Flight Software and Hardware lead on the Seeker Vision project. Seeker Vision was a collaboration between 
NASA Johnson Space Center and UT Austin as part of the Seeker 1 CubeSat mission. UT Austin was contracted to build a full vision system for the satellite, 
including flight software, novel vision algorithms, and robust error handling. Using Tensorflow, our team built a convolutional neural network to detect the 
target spacecraft. Once the target was identified, OpenCV was used to determine relative azimuth and elevation of the target spacecraft. As the Flight Software 
and Hardware lead, I was present at all three mission reviews and presented slides about the state of the various areas of the project I was working on. The 
delivered vision system was recently selected over multiple other vision systems for integration on the Seeker 1 CubeSat mission to launch in April.
