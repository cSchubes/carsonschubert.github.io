# At a Glance
- Open-source, full-stack web application for controlling digital LED lights via Raspberry Pi running [balenaOS](https://www.balena.io/).

- Uses NodeJS, Express, and SQLite to expose a RESTful API for LED control which is hosted onboard the Pi.

- Externally hosted, mobile friendly Vue frontend allows for intuitive light control
and customization of animations/colors that can be named and saved as favorites.

- Integrated with Alexa via [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) allowing for full voice control.

- **Personal Contributions to Date**:  

    - Built system from scratch using separately purchased components.
    - Integrated entire stack (NodeJS, Express, SQLite, Vue).
    - Implemented use of [balenaOS](https://www.balena.io/) for over the air updates and code Dockerization.
    - Architected complex database structure necessary for user-defined custom animations.
